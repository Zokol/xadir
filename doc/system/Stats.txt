2. Combat

2.1 Hitting with a weapon

Every character has natural chance to miss (10-20%) an attack. This will be reduced when character uses a certain weapon long enough. Hit chance will also be affecte from the terrain, armor, classes and magical equipment.
 
ex1. Chance to miss with daggers 10%. Target has a heavy armor, slowing his movement and reducing his miss chance by -5%. Target is in forest giving him bonus 20% to miss chance. Resulting in (10%-5%+20%=) 25% miss chance.

formula: (attacker miss)+-(attacker buffs/debuffs/items)+-(terrain)+-(defender buffs/debuffs/items/armor) 

2.2 Damage

light weapons: daggers, short swords, wand (light magic), etc
damage range: 1-4, 1-6, 

normal weapons: large swords, spears, maces, staff (normal magic), etc
damage range: 2-6, 1-8, 1-10,  

heavy weapons: large axes, large mace
damage range: 2-10, 1-12, 2-12 


(Magic attacks bypass damage reduction completely)

1,5x light weapons 		15%
2,0x normal weapons		10%

ex1. magical dagger could possibly have a critical chance of 17%

	Damage Reduction	Miss chance bonus
Light		0%			5%
