Map data lives here.

The compatibility of two map tiles is defined by their touching borders.
We represent this by dividing each of the four borders of a tile to 2 parts
and walking the border in the clockwise direction starting from the top left corner.

For example, a tile at the border of water (W) and ground (G) would be represented as:
WG
WG

The border of this tile would then translate to WG GG GW WW or WGGGGWWW.
If there are multiple tiles with identical borders but differing contents, we use a
number at the end to differentiate them, on a first drawn first numbered basis.

If the borders are identical in corners, this can be shortened to a four letter code,
which is obtained by walking the corner codes instead. For example, for the previous
example, this code would be WGGW. If the whole block uses the same border, it can be
shortened to just one letter.
